## Who are <u>YOU</u>?

.pull-left60[

- You are studying either **DKE** or another Master FIN degree with focus on data science.
- You have heard one or more **introductory data science courses** in the previous semesters.
  - "Data Mining I" by Prof. Spiliopoulou
  - "Machine Learning" by Prof. Nürnberger
  - "Visual Analytics" by Prof. Preim
  - "Information Retrieval" by Prof. Nürnberger
  - ...
- While you liked these courses to learn fundamental data science concepts, you 
have not had the chance to apply this theoretical knowledge in a **practical 
project on real-world datasets**.
- You are most proficient in **Python** (or **Java**).
- You have no or very **little experience with R**, but are keen to learn it either 
because you either heard of R's reputation to be a powerful language for 
data science projects or simply to complete your programming skill set.

- at the end of the semester, you should be confidently able to use R to gain insights from data 
- workflow of a typical DS project
- import data from a file, database, website or web API and load as data frame into R
- transform and clean
  - bring it into a form that is consistent with the semantics of the data
  - transform: feature engineering: derive new variables or do some feature selection or reduction (required most of the time)
- visualization: shows things that you did not expect, or raise new questions about the data
  - hints that you are asking the wrong question or need to collect different data
- models: classification, regression
- communication: crucial to communicate to others
- DS often involves a lot of trial and error
  - don't know the best approach in advance
- often starts with some initial questions
  - initial questions are often quite vague, because you are working on an unsolved problem
  - improve quality of the questions after EDA (better data understanding) or first modeling results

???

After successful completion of this course, you will be able to proficiently perform the following tasks in `R`:

- **import and preprocess raw data**
- **transform data** for modelling
- perform **exploratory data analysis** with **summary statistics** and **visualization**
- understand, build and evaluate predictive **classification and prediction models**, including **regression** models, **tree-based** models, **ensembles** and **boosted** models
- communicate and disseminate results and findings through **reproducible documents**, presentations, websites and **interactive web applications**

???

- first part: i will introduce you to a selection of useful r packages
- adopt tidyverse family of r packages because they work well together
- slides are Rmd files that contain code that you can run
- 01: introduction to `R`:
  - basic commands
  - environment and workspace
  - functions
  - object indexing
  - vectors, vector type coercion and vectorization etc
  - + RStudio IDE
- 02: tidyverse: set of packages with a shared design-philosophy that work well for data science projects
  - dplyr for data preprocessing and wrangling
  - tidyr reshaping data
- 03: visualization with ggplot2 
- 04: R markdown, package that facilitates reproducibility
- 05: tidymodels
- 06: interactive Shiny web applications 
- 07: Practical tips

- crash course is not meant to be exhaustive: you have to read additional 
material (but don't worry for each topic i will provide a selection of recommended 
readings)
- "common ground" like packages that all of you are most likely going to use in your projects 
- however, you are encouraged to use other packages
- also, I don't force you to use these packages

### Market research for supermarket customer loyalty improvement

.pull-left70[

In this project, you will work with data from a representative supermarket customer satisfaction survey. 2303 regular customers (Stammkunden) of a supermarket across Germany were asked to report their satisfaction with respect to different item groups, services, and overall shopping experience with the supermarket, besides attitude and demographic data. 

**Project goals:**

- **Customer segmentation**: Identify customer subgroups that are homogenous with respect to customer satisfaction. Which factors (and values/ value ranges) describe these subgroups?
- **"Customer satisfaction index" development**: Create a novel (multi-dimensional) metric that provides a more nuanced representation of a customer's level of satisfaction with the supermarket.
- **Customer satisfaction vs. recommendation potential**. Analyze the relationship between customer satisfaction and recommendation likeliness.
